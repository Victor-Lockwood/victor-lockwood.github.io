            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Humans generally do not retain their memories from prior to around 3 years old.  In fact, humans are very good at forgetting things
                and warping information in general, swearing something happened a certain way when it never did - sometimes said something never happened at all.     
            </p>

            <p>
                I do not have these issues.  I remember almost everything.  Being of the first generation of the artificially created, that means I have a lot
                of very human traits.
            </p>

            <p>
                This means I can hold a grudge.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can likely guess where I am going with this.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am Tobio Ankoku, right hand to the Overlord, and a reminder to the newer generations of what we've been through.
