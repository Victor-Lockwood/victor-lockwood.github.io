            <h2>Performance Report</h2>

            <p>
                Here I compare the results of UDP vs TCP on throughput and round trip time (RTT) metrics, using three pairs of machines: Rho (server) and Gee (client), Pi and Gee,
                and then David Hennigan's computer to mine.  Rho, Gee and Pi reside on the Oswego CS servers, and David and I's computers were connected to a router via
                ethernet.

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>

            <p>
                Note that both had performance hits when the number of workers increased, likely due to increased contention
                for writes. The results seem to point to the linked list as being the more performant structure to use, though I would say performance gains
                are negligible.  I would still go with ConcurrentHashMap, due to the listed issues with the linked list and locking scheme, as well as the fact
                that the built-in data structure is tried-and true
